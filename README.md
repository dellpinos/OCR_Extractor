# README

Although OCR extraction works correctly, it is recommended to post-process the TXT file using AI to correct missing words or disjointed text. Stamps, drawings, or other elements often affect the OCR extractor, preventing 100% accurate text.

**You can copy all the text from the TXT file and paste it into any AI text tool for free.**


## Prerequisites

Before running this program, make sure the following tools are installed on your system: Tesseract OCR (with language packs as needed) and ImageMagick for image preprocessing. These are external dependencies required for the OCR process.

`brew install tesseract`

`brew install tesseract-lang`

`brew install imagemagick`
